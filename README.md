## What is this

A collection of common web patterns implemented in Spring Framework.

## Why?

Modern Java web frameworks are powerful, yet it's hard for beginner to use them due to 
- The complexity of modern software architecture
- The tacit knowledges of frameworks.
- The lack of useful documentation.
- The lack of step-by-step guides and explanations for why it is implemented as it is

This repository serves my 2 purposes:
1. My personal memos. I want to learn modern software architecture / design, so I build things.
2. Implements of common patterns in Spring.

Hope it is helpful for someone.
